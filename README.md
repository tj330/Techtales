# Techtales

Techtales is a blogging application built using **Spring Boot**, **JPA**, and **React**. It is designed to provide users with a platform to read and explore engaging technical blogs.
The project is in its initial phase and will include more features in future releases.

## Features
- Currently includes a collection of blogs written by me and my friends.
- More advanced features will be added in upcoming updates.


## Important Information for Users
- **Blog Loading Delay**: Blogs may take up to a minute to load due to the use of Render for deployment. Please be patient while the application fetches the data.
- **Refresh the Base URL**: If the application fails to load, try refreshing the base URL ([https://techtales-blogs.vercel.app/](https://techtales-blogs.vercel.app/)) to retry the connection.
